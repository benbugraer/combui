        ### Install Motion

        We usually use [Motion](https://motion.dev/) as animation in our components.

        ```package-install
        motion
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Install ShadcnUI
    We usually use [ShadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for our components because with shadcn1 we can make some features easier

    ```package-install
    npx shadcn@latest init
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Adding utilty helper
    Create `lib/utils.ts` file and add `cn` function.

    ```ts
    import { ClassValue, clsx } from 'clsx';

import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

    </Step>

    <Step>
      That's all for now, if you need to install another component you want to use, we will inform you about it.
